Bathroom Girl: In the entrails of this world, there are all kinds of strange things. Isn't it wonderful?
Kiki: I wonder.
Bathroom Girl: This is a world of diarrhoea
Kiki: I find your statement to be rude, but I will take it into consideration.
Bathroom Girl: This place hasn't been reached by the influence of the banchou, but be ready
Kiki: I'll be fine, but thanks. By the way, why are you here?
Bathroom Girl: I don't really get along with that bunch over there.
Kiki: Understood. Good luck then.
